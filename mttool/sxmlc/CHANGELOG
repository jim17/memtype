*** v4.0.0
	- Unicode handling through SXMLC_UNICODE define (Use -DSXMLC_UNICODE when compiling).
	- Use 'sx_*' functions to manipulate strings, and C2SX() macro around constant strings and characters to provide portable code for Unicode/non-Unicode compilation.

	- Correction in HowTo

	- Corrected CDATA tag end (!)
	- Added macros to ease memory debugging (define DBG_MEM constant)
	- Added parameters to 'XMLNode_remove_child' and 'XMLDoc_remove_node' to allow for freeing child/node pointer itself
	- Function 'XML_parse_1string' returns 'TAG_ERROR' on error, instead of 'TAG_NONE'
	- Check is made on tag name consistency in "DOM node end callback"
	- Function 'DOMXMLDoc_doc_end' is used as "DOM node end callback" (!)
	- New functions 'XMLNode_get_children_count', 'XMLNode_dup' (allocate and copy)
	- Added XML_DEFAULT_QUOTE to tell which quote " or ' should be used when printing a node
	- New macro 'isquote'

*** v3.4.0

	- #defines are replaced by enums.
	- User-defined tags can be released and accessed.
	- Added an 'examples' folder.
	- Added AUTHOR and CHANGELOG files.
	- Changed method 'XMLNode_set_comment' into more generic 'XMLNode_set_type'.

*** v3.3.1
	- Added 'XMLDoc_remove_node' that didn't exist!
	- Added an option to 'XML*_print' to prevent printing "pretty-print" separators.
	- 'XMLDoc_print' no longer prints a new line as the first line (a.k.a "UGLY HACK").

*** v3.3.0
	- Corrected problem on child nodes association.
	- Added parser for buffer, not only files (changed prototype of "read_line_alloc").
	- Added SAX callbacks for document start and end.
	- Added an error handler for SAX.
	- Changed the parameter on SAX callbacks to get access to line number and data source name.
	- Tests are made on proper initialization of XMLDoc and XMLNode structures.

*** v3.2.0
	- Include DOCTYPE tag.
	- Unified DOM parse to use SAX callbacks.
	- Added an "all-in-one" callback for SAX parser.
	- Added support of user-defined tags.
